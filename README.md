# EyeTrack
_Media player with eye tracking functionality_
<br />
<br />
# Description
  EyeTrack is a module for VLC Media Player that supports real-time eye tracking. The program will detect when a user looks away from their screen, and automatically pause the media until they look back. In the interest of user convenience, different attention thresholds can be set dependant on the type of media being played. For instance, a student taking notes on a recorded lecture may want a longer window before the video pauses than someone watching a TV show with subtitles. Additionally, the eye tracking module can be used to verify a user's attention in the event a company has mandatory training, a college course factors attendance/participation towards students' grades, or any other situation in which attention is required. Python's OpenCV library will provide the necessary framework to retrofit VLC with eye tracking capabilities.
